              RollingHub is a start-up Web3 application positioned as an NFT
              liquidity protocol. The project utilized React for frontend, Java
              for backend, MySQL as the database, and was hosted on AWS. The
              platform allows sellers to craft unique loot boxes filled with
              high-value NFTs, which are marketed via lottery tickets. This
              innovative model gives users the chance to acquire premium NFTs at
              a fraction of the cost while enabling sellers to efficiently
              monetize their assets at their targeted price point.
