            RollingHub is a start-up Web3 application positioned as an NFT
            liquidity protocol. The project utilized React for frontend, Java
            for backend, MySQL as the database, and was hosted on AWS. The
            platform allows sellers to craft unique loot boxes filled with
            high-value NFTs, which are marketed via lottery tickets. This
            innovative model gives users the chance to acquire premium NFTs at a
            fraction of the cost while enabling sellers to efficiently monetize
            their assets at their targeted price point.
